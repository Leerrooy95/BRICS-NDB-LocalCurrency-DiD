# BRICS Kazan/Rio DiD — The Switch Was Flipped (November 2025)

October 2024. Kazan Summit. The partner tier goes live.

The New Development Bank flipped the switch.

**+25.5 percentage points** in local-currency lending.  
**+23–28 pp** in digital / AI-adjacent infrastructure lending.

The jump happened **the exact month** the partner tier was created.

MINT controls (Mexico, Indonesia, Nigeria, Türkiye) stayed flat the entire time.

This is not gradual. This is not rhetoric. This is a vertical structural break.
